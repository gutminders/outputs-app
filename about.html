  <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  <p>We are Ana and Alek, two people behind this sh*t. We genuinely believe that bowel movement frequency is an important health biomarker, and that tracking your poop should be as normal as tracking your steps or calories. Now, you have the tool to count your "goes."</p>
  <p><strong>Thank you for downloading our app!</strong></p>

  <h1>Poop Tracker: Outputs</h1>
  <p>Regular and normal bowel movements are great indicators of good health. Effortlessly track and analyze your bowel movement habits with Outputs, a discreet, user-friendly and free poop tracker app. This simple practice can support you in improving your well-being, lifestyle, and eating habits.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Easy Tracking:</strong> One button is all you need to track with minimal distraction. No detailed forms or screens.</li>
    <li><strong>Timer:</strong> Displays time between logs on the main screen.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar and History:</strong> View, edit, or delete logs in a calendar view.</li>
    <li><strong>Metrics and charts:</strong> Identify irregularities linked to constipation, IBS, or liver/gallbladder issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy and Data:</strong> Data is stored locally. Share it with a doctor, or keep it personal.</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral visual design:</strong> Use without embarrassmentâ€”minimalist and discreet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>People track steps, diet, workouts, water intake, sleep, pulse, etc., yet â€˜embarrassingâ€™ bathroom-related concerns are often overlooked, despite stool checking being an effective and affordable form of health screening.</p>

  <p>While bowel movement frequency is linked to long-term health, around 30â€“40% of adults experience digestive problems that affect their livesâ€”yet many feel uncomfortable seeking help.</p>

  <p>We know self-tracking can be inconsistent, awkward, or just time-consuming. So we created Outputs: a gut health journal with a neutral design, one button, one chart, and a few smart metrics to help you get started. The more you track, the more you notice.</p>

  <p><strong>Watch this space!</strong> Future versions will bring more tools to help you monitor your digestive health.</p>
