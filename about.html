    <h2>Hi there!</h2>
    <p>We genuinely believe that bowel movement frequency is an important health biomarker, and that tracking poop should be as normal as tracking steps or calories. Now, you have the tool to count your "goes"</p>
    <p>Thank you for downloading our app!</p>

    <h2>Poop Tracker: Outputs</h2>
    <p>Regular and normal bowel movements are great indicators of good health. Effortlessly track and analyze your bowel movement habits with Outputs, a discreet, user-friendly and free poop tracker app. This simple practice can support you in improving your well-being, lifestyle, and eating habits.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Easy Tracking:</strong> One button is all you need to track with minimal distraction. Thereâ€™s no need to enter detailed information or navigate through multiple screens.</li>
      <li><strong>Timer:</strong> Timer on the main screen displays time between logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Calendar and History:</strong> Logs are available in the calendar. Add, edit, or delete any log.</li>
      <li><strong>Metrics and charts:</strong> Discover patterns and use them to identify irregularities that may be related to constipation, IBS, liver or gallbladder dysfunction.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy and Data:</strong> Data is stored on your device. Share data with your doctor, health coach, or nutritionist, or keep it for personal reference.</li>
      <li><strong>Neutral visual design:</strong> Donâ€™t feel embarrassed using a â€˜poop tracking appâ€™. Open it without any feelings of discomfort or embarrassment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>People track steps, diet, workouts, water intake, sleep, pulse, etc., yet â€˜embarrassingâ€™ bathroom-related concerns are often overlooked, in spite of stool checking being an effective and affordable form of health screening.</p>

    <p>While it is found that bowel movement frequency is linked to long-term health, around 30-40% of adults have digestive problems, affecting their quality of life, with many feeling uncomfortable seeking medical support or advice.</p>

    <p>We also understand that self-tracking can be time-consuming, overwhelming, and inconsistent. Plus, the very thought of poop tracking can be mortifying. Users often abandon tracking because it takes time or they donâ€™t know how to interpret all the fancy data.</p>
    
    <p>Recognizing the challenges of self-tracking, weâ€™ve created Outputs, a gut health journal with a neutral and welcoming design, one button, one chart, and a couple of comprehensive metrics to kickstart your gut health journey. The more you track, the more you will notice.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Watch this space!</strong> In future releases, weâ€™ll be adding more features to complement your digestive health monitoring and benefit your overall health.</p>
